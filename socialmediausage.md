## Social Media Usage Analysis

**Project description:**
In my experience, increased social media usage leaves me feeling worse off, and I was curious if there was data documenting a relation between emotional state and social media usage. I analysed a dataset from Kaggle and created a Tableau Public dashboard to explore this relationship.

[View the Tableau dashboard here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tulika.khargonkar/viz/Project-SocialMediaDashboard/dashboard).

### 1. Data Sources Used

The data I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being). This dataset was prepared by Emirhan Bulut and uploaded to Kaggle. Social media users reported their dominant emotional state along with engagement metrics such as posts, likes, comments, and messages per day.

I chose to work with the train.csv file in the dataset, which includes data from 1000 unique users.

### 2. Documentation Of Cleaning And Manipulation Of Data

The chosen data was cleaned for data accuracy and data validation using Microsoft Excel.
Duplicate entries were removed using Excel's built-in function. Some inconsistencies in the data included swapping of values between various columns; for example, the "Age" and "Gender" columns, had swapped values in a few rows which were rectified. One row contained improper data and was deleted. 

### 3. Highlights Of Analysis

* The average time users spent on social media per day is 96 minutes.
* The most popular social media platform was Instagram, followed by Twitter/X and Facebook. Most of Facebook's users identify as non-binary. Most of Instagram's users are female, and most of Twitter/X's users are male.
* Most people reported Happiness and Neutrality as their dominant emotion. As daily usage time increased, happiness and anxiety became the most frequently reported dominant emotions.

* Users who reported their dominant emotion as Happiness spent the most time on social media per day (150 minutes!) with the highest number of average engagement metrics (likes, messages, comments, and posts per day) compared to users reporting other dominant emotions.
* Younger users (ages 21 - 27) predominantly reported Neutrality and Sadness as their dominant emotion, followed closely by Happiness. Older users (ages 28 - 35), in contrast, reported Happiness and Boredom.
* The older the users, the more reported Boredom as the dominant emotion!
* The gender distribution of emotions, although not starkly different, shows the following:
  - Female users are dominantly Happy social media users.
  - Non-binary users are dominantly Neutral social media users.
  - Male users are fairly unbiased, although Happiness is still the most frequently reported dominant emotion.


### 4. Key Findings

* Users spend nearly one and a half hour on social media per day.
* Happiness and Anxiety were the most frequently reported dominant emotions as daily usage time increased. Boredom was the most frequently reported dominant emotion for the least daily usage time.
* However, users who reported Happiness as their dominant emotion had the highest _engagement_ with their chosen social media platform, including likes, messages, comments and posts.
* Perhaps more social media _engagement_ is the key to happiness, after all? Perhaps more datasets need to be investigated to report conclusive findings.
