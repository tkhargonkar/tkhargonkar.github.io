## Social Media Usage Analysis

**Project description:**
In my experience, increased social media usage leaves me feeling worse off, and I was curious if there was data documenting a relation between emotional state and social media usage. I analysed a dataset from Kaggle and created a dashboard using Tableau public to investigate the same.

### 1. Data Sources Used

The data I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being). This dataset was prepared by Emirhan Bulut and uploaded to Kaggle. Social media users reported their dominant emotional state along with engagement metrics such as posts, likes, comments, and messages per day.

I chose to work with the train.csv file in the dataset, which includes data from 1000 unique users.

### 2. Documentation Of Cleaning And Manipulation Of Data

The chosen data was cleaned for data accuracy and data validation. One empty field was populated based on column averages
