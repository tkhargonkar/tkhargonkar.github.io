### [Linking Arousal Metrics and Decision-Making](/nma2024)

As a participant of the Neuromatch Academy 2024 Computational Neuroscience course, I worked with my pod members to analyse a mouse behavioural dataset. We explored different avenues of measuring an animal's arousal state and linking it with decision making.
