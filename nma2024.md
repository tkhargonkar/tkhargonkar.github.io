## Linking Arousal States and Decision-Making - NMA2024 Project

Building on scientific research by Steinmetz et. al., 2019, my team members and I explored the potential of a composite arousal metric to predict behavioural task performance.

### 1. Introduction

Neuroscientifically, "arousal" states broadly refer to an animal's task engagement, attention and activity. These can be indirectly measured using changes in pupil size or facial movement. In the dataset used here, brain activity was recorded from mice engaged in a visual task. We aimed to generate a _composite_ measure of various arousal state indicators to see whether we could more accurately predict the animal's accuracy in the visual task.

We used Python through Google Colab's notebook setup to perform our data exploration, analysis, and visualisation.
I contributed to data cleaning, EDA, statistical techniques (including linear regression, factor analysis, and t-tests).
I contributed to creating data visualisations and a PowerPoint presentation for the project.

### 2. Data Sources

The primary dataset for the project originated from Steinmetz et. al.'s work on brain acitivity in task-engaged mice, the publication for which can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1787-x), and the data source for which can be found [here](https://github.com/nsteinme/steinmetz-et-al-2019/tree/master/behavior).

Support for the project was provided by Neuromatch Academy's resources and mentors, who provided help in everything from EDA to the basics of Python syntax. My team members, Christa, Emily, and Hyungju's expertise on data manipulation in Python and computational neuroscience was immensely helpful as well.

Our key findings include the following:
- Arousal metrics are not strong indicators of task performance.
- A session-wide factor score performed better than individual arousal metrics.
- Hippocampal brain regions were implicated in modulating arousal metrics.

In the future, we hope to use modelling approaches to create a composite arousal measure that might predict decision accuracy better, and seek datasets with less noisy pupil and face data.
